# Ciphers
Collection of different ciphers. 

Each cipher program is able to encrypt a message in conjunction with a key such that the message is not decipherable
without knowledge of the encryption message and the key. The encrypted message can then be decrypted through the same program.

1. Caesar cipher: shifts individual characters in encrypted message by integer key.
  i.e 'abcde' with key = 2 -> 'cdefg'
  Decryption difficulty: miniscule
